Step 1: compile the demo:
  g++ demo.cpp -o demo -Llibs -lrecording -std=c++0x -Iinclude

Step 2: run the demo:
  1) let $RECORDING_BIN_PATH denote the directory where |libmediasdk.so|, |agora_recorder| and |libHDACEngine.so| reside,
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${RECORDING_BIN_PATH}
    export PATH=${PATH}:${RECORDING_BIN_PATH}
  2) change the configuration.
     mkdir -p ${YOUR_RECORDING_DIR}
     edit the file /etc/agora.d/recording.conf, add the following line into the file:
       record on
       directory ${YOUR_RECORDING_DIR)
  3) run: ./demo. The voice data will be stored on ${YOUR_RECORDING_DIR)
    with the name of CID-UID-JOIN_TS.agr, where CID is the channel id, UID the speaker
    id, and JOIN_TS the timestamp joined in. There will be multiple agora recording files
    if multiple speakers have joined the same channel.

# This demo will join the channel PSTN_CHANNEL, and write down all others' voices.
#  To view the logging message, see the file where syslog prints to

  4) to replay the voice, run:
     agora_player --input the_agr_file --output the_pcm_file_path [--speed (1|2|5|10)]
  5) Further format conversion can be done by using any audio commercial product
    as you wish, after a pcm file is generated.
